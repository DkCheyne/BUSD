BUSD- Back-Up Slow Down
This is attemp number three at writing code that will not only use the enocders to move a set distance, autonBase, it is also an attempt at implementing slow down code. 

UPDATE: As of 1-28-17 all three of these goals have been met in atleast some capcity. This code over the course of it's creation has morphed from being a simple slow down routine into the full blown competition code for team 2581B over the 2016-2017 vex competition season. Also at this time I am not sure how much more will be added to the code. So I'll put down what I know will happen from here
  1: Auton Code - The current auton is incredibly basic and only takes a fraction of the amount of time slotted to complete. So I am over the course of the next five days going to add a more sophisticated routine. As both moveFoward() and turnTo() work.
  2: turnTo - As it stands right now the function isn't very accurate. So over the next week or so I am going to go through the process of tuning the robot and creating the graphs showing how the whole process of PID works. 
  3: Code cleanliness - This is one of the biggest weakness's of this whole project. I am slowly trying to improve this code and make it follow the best practices more. Honestly I'm not sure how much more I am going to do about this simply because this code will probably never be used again (I hope not).
